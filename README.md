# Sales Performance EDA & Tableau Dashboard
This Tableau project, Sales EDA Dashboard, presents an exploratory analysis of sales performance using interactive charts and KPIs. It highlights key metrics such as sales amount, profit percentage, customer distribution, and order trends to reveal insights for data-driven business decisions

## Key Business Insights
Based on the Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and the final dashboard, the following insights were revealed:
* **Profit Concentration:** The furniture category contributes 29.5%, electronics - 38.3% and clothing 32.2% to the sales.
* **Regional Performance:** The analysis identifies Indore and Mumbai as the primary performance hubs, dominating both order volume and overall  profitability across all product categories.
* **Profit vs Sales Relationship:** The Profit vs Sales Amount scatter plot reveals a significant cluster of high-volume, low-profit transactions. These transactions, coloured orange, indicate products or customer segments that drive substantial revenue but generate little to no margin, pointing to critical pricing or cost issues.
* **Profitability Warning:** Cities such as Patna, Jaipur, and Goa are flagged as areas with low or negative profit margins, despite moderate  volume, requiring immediate operational review.
